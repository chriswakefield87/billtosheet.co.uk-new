        "question": "Can BillToSheet handle multi-page invoices?",
        "answer": "Yes, our converter processes all pages of a PDF invoice. Line items that span multiple pages are combined into a single output, and header information is extracted from the relevant pages."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are all line items from all pages extracted?",
        "answer": "Yes, our system reads through all pages and extracts every line item, regardless of how many pages the invoice spans. The line items are combined into a single CSV file."

      {
        "question": "What if my invoice has summary pages?",
        "answer": "Some invoices include summary pages with subtotals. Our converter distinguishes between line items and summaries, extracting individual line items while capturing totals from summary sections."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are page headers handled?",
        "answer": "Repeated headers (like company name and address on each page) are extracted once and not duplicated. We identify the main invoice information and avoid creating duplicate entries."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a page limit for invoices?",
        "answer": "There's no specific page limit. As long as the PDF is under 10MB, we can process invoices with any number of pages. Very long invoices (50+ pages) may take slightly longer to process."
